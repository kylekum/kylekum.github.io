				<p><b>Scritch</b> the cat is Pencil’s <b>best friend</b> and sister. Scritch is about 3 and half years old and her exact breed is unknown because she was a rescue. Scritch and Pencil enjoy cuddling with each other and occasionally they will fight. Scritch is bigger than Pencil so Scritch usually ends up winning the fights. Now you are also probably wondering why the cat’s name is Scritch. And you are also probably thinking that this family has outrageous names for their animals, which you would not be wrong about. Her name comes from when she was still a kitten. Her family noticed that she liked to scratch a lot, so they would tell the cat to “stop scritch scratching.” Long story short, they ended up telling the cat to “stop scritch scratching” so much that they decided to just name the cat scritch. </p>
