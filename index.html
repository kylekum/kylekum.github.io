				<P><b>Pencil</b> was born on July 25th, 2019 in Madison, WI. She is a unique breed called a <b>Chiweenie</b>, which is a mix of a Chihuahua and a Weiner dog. She has a loving family that consists of two parents and three siblings. One of those siblings is actually her best friend, which you can learn more about by clicking the “Best Friend” tab on the top of this webpage. Pencil now lives very close to Madison in Cambridge, WI(30 minutes from Madison) and loves it there. Most of her free time is spent being a Social Media Influencer on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pencil_the_chiweenie/">Instagram</a>. Now with all of this information out of the way, you might be wondering why her name is Pencil and there is only one answer to that question. The reason her name is Pencil is because her family decided that she looked just like an actual pencil. On top of this, the name is very unique. I mean who else has a dog named Pencil? <p>
